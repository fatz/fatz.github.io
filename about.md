## Jan Ulferts

I'm a **linux system engineer** focused automation and scalability. I've worked a couple of Years for [XING](https://xing.com) building Infrastructure and Systems automation as well as Monitoring these. Currently I'm working at [Goodgame Studios](https://www.goodgamestudios.com) doing automation on a global scale.
